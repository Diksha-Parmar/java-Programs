//Create a class named Rectangle with two data members- length and breadth and a
//function to calculate the area which is length*breadth. The class has three
//constructors which are :
//1 - having no parameter - values of both length and breadth are assigned zero.
//2 - having two numbers as parameters - the two numbers are assigned as length and
//breadth respectively.
